In the article, we presented both \emph{principal component analysis} and \emph{linear discriminant analysis} methods, which are very useful as a pre-processing step for data analysis. We showed that their naive definitions are limited in some way, and improved the equations to use the famous kernel trick, that outcomes their shortcomings.

It must be noted that it makes sens to use both PCA and LDA on a data-set, since they are complementary methods. However, as an unsupervised methods, PCA doesn't require the labeling of the data-set to be known, while LDA does.
